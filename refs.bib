	abstract = {I study how the nomination of an extremist changes general-election outcomes and legisla- tive behavior in the U.S. House, 1980–2010, using a regression discontinuity design in primary elections. When an extremist—as measured by primary-election campaign receipt patterns— wins a “coin-flip” election over a moderate, the party’s general-election vote share decreases by approximately 9–13 percentage points, and the probability that the party wins the seat de- creases by 35–54 percentage points. These negative effects persist, without diminishing, for eight years—the entire redistricting period. This electoral penalty is so large that randomly nominating the more extreme primary candidate causes the district’s subsequent roll-call repre- sentation to reverse, becoming more liberal when an extreme Republican is nominated and more conservative when an extreme Democrat is nominated. In safe districts, however, the electoral penalty to extremism and the resulting roll-call reversal dissipate. The tradeoff that primary voters face between supporting “electable” candidates and supporting more ideological candi- dates thus varies across district types. Finally, I show that the penalty to extremism does not appear to be driven by differences in candidate quality or incumbency status between moderates and extremists, but is larger in districts where voters have more information about candidates and their positions.},
